# Continuity Activation Tool 2 - built by dokterdok
#
# Description: This script enables OS X 10.10 and 10.11 Continuity features when compatible hardware is detected.
# Continuity features activated by this tool include Application Handoff, Instant Hotspot, and New Airdrop.
# The tool has no influence over Call/SMS Handoff.
#
# Before the actual patching happens, a system compatibility test is made,
# as well as a backup of the bluetooth and wifi kexts. A backup of the patched kexts is also made.
# The System Diagnostic produces a report of typical parameters influencing Continuity.
# An uninstaller is available as well, which restores the original drivers, or, if not present, the drivers from the OS X recovery disk.
